# 🧠 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) - 42 Project

A simple feedforward neural network built entirely from scratch in Python — **without using any machine learning frameworks** (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn).

> This project was developed as part of the 42 curriculum to deepen understanding of machine learning fundamentals and neural network mechanics.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Implement a **multilayer perceptron (MLP)** from the ground up.
- Gain a solid grasp of:
  - Forward propagation
  - Backpropagation
  - Gradient descent
  - Training on labeled datasets
- Handle basic binary and multi-class classification problems.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Configurable architecture: number of layers, neurons per layer.
- Supported activation function: **ReLU**.
- Loss function: **Cross-Entropy**.
- Training feedback: live monitoring of **loss**, **accuracy**, etc.
